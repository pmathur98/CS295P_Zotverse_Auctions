As a part of the CS295 Keystone Project, the ZotVerse auctions team has devised this basic design protype to give the next team an insight into our idea and how to move forward with this pitch.

This in no way should restrict the teams to implement a new feature or idea into this design, however, the main structure behind the proposal should remain the same.
